### Overview of the Project

>The purpose of this analysis was to organize, sort, and analyze the crowd funding data to determine how other campaigns performed in relation to Louise's play "Fever", based on launch dates and funding goals. The dataset contains kickstarter data from other campaigns involving various variables such as category, goals, pledged funds, launch dates, deadlines, etc. The analysis and visualization were performed through excel, found at https://github.com/abrarhaque98/kickstarter-analysis-Module-1/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx.xlsx
